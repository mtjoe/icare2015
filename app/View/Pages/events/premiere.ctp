	<div class="small-width synopsis" style="padding-top: 100px;">
		<p>Indonesia is prominently exceeding expectations in its ability to multiply growth in various aspects. It is currently the largest ASEAN economy with outstanding track record for the past 10 years, both in the political and economic sector (Australian Trade Commission, 2014). It is the economy to be involved in, be it in the consumer goods sector, up until the development and infrastructure sector. With expectation of Indonesia to grow even further in 2015, it is well predicted that the need for quality human resources will keep on rising for the next few years.</p><br>
		<p>The Premiere will mark the opening of the 2015 Indonesian Career Expo, bringing in valued speakers whom have dedicated their life to improving Indonesia through having studied internationally, and coming back home. Why do we as Indonesians have the duty to come back home and improve our nation? How are we going to make a difference in a place where we belong? The Premiere will be the source of answers to bring you back home!</p><br>

					<h2 style="font-size: 30px;">Emirsyah Satar</h2><br><br>
					<p>Emirsyah Satar was born in Jakarta, Indonesia on June 28th, 1956. Satar graduated with a Commerce degree from Universitas Indonesia (Univeristy of Indonesia). Satar’s most prominent role was during his time as CEO of Indonesia’s national airline, Garuda Indonesia.</p>
					<p>Satar’s career started when he was still attending university, working as an accountant for PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Following his graduation, he worked as an Assistant of Vice President of Citibank’s Corporate Banking. Satar’s other employment includes Vice CEO at PT Bank Danamon Indonesia and President Director at PT Niaga Factoring Corporation. </p>
					<p>In 2003, Satar left the banking world to join with Garuda Indonesia as their Chief Financial Officer. Then in 2005 he was trusted for the job as CEO, becoming the youngest to have taken up the position. From an airline in crisis when Satar started as the CEO, he was able to turn its fortunes around and establish Garuda Indonesia as a profit-making premium airline. He dramatically improved the airline’s accounts, safety and reputation. </p>
					<p>In an interview, Satar is quoted in saying, “And if Indonesians don't help this country, who will?... Garuda is an Indonesian icon… And I am a proud Indonesian.” His drive to tackle new challenges and help improve Indonesia to be a better country makes him an icon in the corporate world and role-model to many aspiring Indonesians. He was awarded with the 2013 CNBC 2013 Travel Business Leader Award Asia Pacific.</p>
